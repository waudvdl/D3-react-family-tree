## Requirements

For requirements check ericGartner's requirements(https://github.com/ErikGartner/dTree#requirements). you should also have at least Node.js version 16 or higher.

## Usage

For usage check the home.tsx file. keep in mind when using thi you should keep the data in the correct form as described in this js fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/rha8sg79/ When using this project be aware of the version settings and global imports of lodash and the styling DO NOT CHANGE THESE. Otherwise this won't work. Feel free to contribute or send me a message for one of these problems.
This code is not ready for professional usage. This code is still in development stage. This code still needs a d3 version which is capable of building family trees with multiple roots and building a complex graph. Which at this moments can't work together because for both purposes we need a different version of d3.
For running the dev server run npm run dev.

>npm run dev
